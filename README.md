# Attack Range Surge‚öîÔ∏è
![Attack Range Log](docs/surge_logo.png)

## Purpose üõ°
The Attack Range is a detection development platform, which solves three main challenges in detection engineering. First, the user is able to build quickly a small lab infrastructure as close as possible to a production environment. Second, the Attack Range performs attack simulation using different engines such as Atomic Red Team or Caldera in order to generate real attack data. Third, it integrates seamlessly into any Continuous Integration / Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) pipeline to automate the detection rule testing process.  

## Installation üèó

### [AWS and MacOS](https://github.com/splunk/attack_range/wiki/AWS:-MacOS-Installation)

1. `git clone https://raw.githubusercontent.com/davisshannon/attack_range_surge`
2. `cd into the attack range directory`
3. `mv attack_range.conf.template attack_range.conf`
4. `edit attack_range.conf with at least the following items. leave others alone`
- `attack_range_password should be something unique.  this is what user passwords get set to on Windows and Splunk hosts, including admin/administrator.`
- `key_name needs to match an AWS security key name in the region you are spinning this up in.`
- `private_key_path needs to be the private key on your local host that matches the AWS security key name in prior step.`
- `region should be the region you are spinning this up in in AWS.`
- `range_name should be something aligned with what you are doing with this range.`
- `change any items to 1 under [environment] that you want to spin up.  Phantom needs login details, and ES is best deployed after the full install is done.`
- `users.yml should be updated if users change/leave/join.  this is where ACL's are created in AWS for inbound access, along with SSH keys for authentication.`
6. `run ./scripts/surge_init.sh to initialise the environment.`
7. `run aws configure to configure your aws client.`
8. `run source venv/bin/activate to enter the virtual environment.`
9. `run python attack_range.py build to build the range.`

## Architecture üèØ
![Logical Diagram](docs/attack_range_architecture.png)

The virtualized deployment of Attack Range consists of:

- Windows Domain Controller
- Windows Server
- Windows Workstation
- A Kali Machine
- Splunk Server
- Phantom Server
- Zeek Sensor

Which can be added/removed/configured using [attack_range.conf](https://github.com/davisshannon/attack_range_conf/blob/develop/attack_range.conf.template). More machines such as Phantom, Linux server, Linux client, MacOS clients are currently under development.

#### Logging
The following log sources are collected from the machines:
- Everything should be in index=main.

## Running üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Attack Range supports different actions:

- Configuring Attack Range
- Build Attack Range
- Perform Attack Simulation
- Test with Attack Range
- Destroy Attack Range
- Stop Attack Range
- Resume Attack Range
- Dump Log Data from Attack Range

### Build Attack Range
```
python attack_range.py build
```

### Show Attack Range Infrastructure
```
python attack_range.py show
```

### Perform Attack Simulation
```
python attack_range.py simulate -st T1003.001 -t ar-win-dc-default-username-33048
```

### Test with Attack Range
```
python attack_range.py test -tf tests/T1003_001.yml
```

### Destroy Attack Range
```
python attack_range.py destroy
```

### Stop Attack Range
```
python attack_range.py stop
```

### Resume Attack Range
```
python attack_range.py resume
```

### Dump Log Data from Attack Range
```
python attack_range.py dump -dn data_dump
```


### Replay Dumps into Attack Range Splunk Server
- Replay previously saved dumps from Attack Range

```
python attack_range.py replay -dn data_dump [--dump NAME_OF_DUMP]
```

- default will dump all enabled dumps described in `attack_data/dumps.yml`
- with optional argument `--dump` you can specify which dump to replay

```
python attack_range.py replay -dn data_dump --dump windows_sec_events
```
